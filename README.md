The Northwestern Black Sea (NWBS) have a wide range of beaches which are exposed to different wind wave conditions. In this sense, safeBeachBS is an application which helps to identify hazardous conditions at beaches.

- Ropotamo Beach (Bulgary)
- Kavatsite Beach(Bulgary)
- Burgas Beach (Bulgary)
- Sunny Beach (Bulgary)
- Modern Beach (Romenia)
